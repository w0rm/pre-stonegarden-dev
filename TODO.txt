1. New page types (catalog, category, product) and their forms
	Templates for new page types (in config)
	Config entry to specify page dependencies (do we need this?)

	Models for catalog/category/product pages
	Custom front-end menu and forms for catalog/category/product


3. Cut/copy/paste on blocks and documents

4. Edit page code dialog

5. Render the following forms in templates by parts:
